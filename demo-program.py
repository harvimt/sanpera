# XXX hey here's what to do next champ
# -  support /writing/
# -  support reading the builtin special images?
# -  support overriding the image type detection
# 2. fix yo hierarchy.  there's probably a pure-python Image, inherits from cython BaseImage with all the real stuff, which stores a list of RawFrames, and also there's a SingleImage somewhere i guess??
# 3. write some tests somehow
# 4. make resizing and cropping work about as well as they do in convert
# 5. implement pixel access
# 6. check out whether that foo.jpg[600x400] syntax is worth doing

# x. check for memory leaks, throw MemoryError when necessary, etc.
